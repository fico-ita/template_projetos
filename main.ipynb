    "# Markowitz Minimum Variance Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "The Markowitz Minimum Variance Portfolio is a fundamental concept in modern portfolio theory, introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952. The goal of this portfolio is to minimize the overall risk (or variance) for a given set of assets, without considering the expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portfolio Variance:** The measure of risk in a portfolio, defined as the weighted sum of the variances of individual assets and the covariances between them. It's calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\sigma_p^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j \\sigma_{ij}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  Where:\n",
    "  - $\\sigma_p^2$ is the portfolio variance.\n",
    "  - $w_i $ and $w_j$ are the weights of assets $i$ and $j$ in the portfolio.\n",
    "  - $\\sigma_{ij}$ is the covariance between assets $i$ and $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimum Variance Portfolio:** Among all possible portfolios, this portfolio has the lowest possible variance. It is found by solving an optimization problem that minimizes portfolio variance subject to the constraint that the sum of the asset weights equals one:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\min \\sigma_p^2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risk Minimization:** The primary focus is on minimizing risk rather than maximizing return. This makes it particularly attractive for risk-averse investors.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Diversification:** By combining assets that are not perfectly correlated, the portfolio reduces unsystematic risk through diversification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Frontier:** The minimum variance portfolio is one of the portfolios on the efficient frontier, which represents the set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a given level of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assumptions:** The model assumes that asset returns are normally distributed and that past performance can predict future returns, which may not always hold true.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Data Sensitivity:** The results are highly sensitive to the input data, particularly the covariance matrix, which can lead to estimation errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its limitations, the Markowitz Minimum Variance Portfolio remains a cornerstone of portfolio management and a valuable tool for risk management."
